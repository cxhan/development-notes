## Daily work

I was still drinking coffee early in the morning, strolling around the Nuggets, and suddenly got a bug order. The beautiful mood collapsed instantly.

The rough question is as follows:

It is the verification problem of a form. Because Vue is usually used when doing business projects, it has been packaged very well. Including the form verification is also uniformly managed by the encapsulated `validate.ts`, The garbage code submitted at one time caused this problem. ðŸ˜…

``` typescript
// Framework: Vue2+Element
const form = {
  //Field must be a array type
  field2: [] as any[]
}
const rule = {
  field: [{
    required: true,
    trigger: "change",
    validator: (rule, value, callback) => {
      // There will be a logic judgment check whether the length of the field length is greater than 0
      // Note that this is another field that is not used for Value
      if (!this?.form?.field2?.length > 0) {
        callback('field lack');
      } else {
        callback();
      }
    }
  }]
}

mounted() {
  // assign to variable 'field'
  this.form.field2 = ['123', '666']
}
```

When submitting the form, you will check the length of Field, but no matter how you modify the value of Form.Field, the verification is always unable to pass.

At this time, I noticed that because we usually encapsulated the verification method, I was lazy here, and directly wrote the verification method on a reference variable. `this` can not get the value of `form`, so `this.form` is undefined. I  made a particularly low-level error, the solution is to just pull out the verification method, so as to solve the problem.

``` typescript
...
validator: validateMethod
...
validateMethod(rule, value, callback) {
  // Since Method and Form are in the same level, this here can get the value of Form
  if (!this?.form?.field2?.length > 0) {
    callback('field lack');
  } else {
    callback();
  }
}
```

## Study daily

It is very interesting to see an interview question. How to create an environment to prevent users from obtaining the DOM and call interface
